            “Off The Beaten Track was and is the most beautiful, magical, and dreamy place to get married. Me and my husband recently had a fall wedding with the leaves falling, the creek running, and the gorgeous hanging lights Gail has hung throughout the venue made it even more perfect. Gail is the sweetest most helpful lady to work with. She let me and my family decorate all week when most venues only let you decorate the night before. We made so many memories, and can’t thank Gail enough for creating such a beautiful place for families to gather. If you are looking for a venue I 100% recommend Off The Beaten Track!” - Lakyn
