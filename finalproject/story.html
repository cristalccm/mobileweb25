<h2 class="otbt">Our Story</h2>
  <p class="tag">Nestled in the heart of Nashville, Arkansas, Off the Beaten Track is more than an event venue — it's a story of transformation, history, and heart.</p>
  <p class="tale">What once stood as a forgotten industrial building has been reimagined into a stunning 6,000-square-foot space designed for unforgettable celebrations. Originally built in the 1960s as a manufacturing facility for soil products, the building served many roles — from a bustling warehouse to a trucking hub — before sitting vacant for years.
 That all changed in 2018, when owner Gail Hearnsberger saw its potential. With a vision for restoration and a passion for breathing life back into historic spaces, she embarked on a “sow's ear to silk purse” renovation journey.
  When discussing the renovations with a friend, Gail described the location with a smile:
    “Well, it's just off the beaten track.”
    The name was perfect — and it stuck.
    Today, Off the Beaten Track is a place where rustic character meets elegant design — ideal for weddings, reunions, corporate events, and celebrations of every kind.
        Step off the beaten path and experience a venue as unique as your story.</p>
