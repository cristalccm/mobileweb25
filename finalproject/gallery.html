<div class="reviews">
  <div class="column">“Off The Beaten Track was and is the most beautiful, magical, and dreamy place to get married. Me and my husband recently had a fall wedding with the leaves falling, the creek running, and the gorgeous hanging lights Gail has hung throughout the venue made it even more perfect. Gail is the sweetest most helpful lady to work with. She let me and my family decorate all week when most venues only let you decorate the night before. We made so many memories, and can't thank Gail enough for creating such a beautiful place for families to gather. If you are looking for a venue I 100% recommend Off The Beaten Track!” - Lakyn </div>
  <div class="column">“Our wedding at Off the Beaten Track was amazing! I've known Gail since I was a little girl
    and she's always been such a sweet lady! The venue was perfect and Gail
    made sure we had the perfect day!” -Cristal </div>
  <div class="column">“Off the Beaten Track is the perfect wedding venue I'm so glad we chose to have our wedding here, it was the perfect match! The venue speaks for itself and has so much to offer! Gail has the most beautiful decor to choose from and this venue tops all of the other venues I toured when planning my wedding! 10/10 recommend getting married at Off the Beaten Track!!” - Kristen </div>
